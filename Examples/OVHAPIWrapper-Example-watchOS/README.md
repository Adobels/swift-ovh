In order to run this example, you have to copy the file `Examples/OVHAPIWrapper-Example-watchOS/Resources/Credentials-Sample.plist` to `Examples/OVHAPIWrapper-Example-watchOS/Resources/Credentials.plist` and to set the application key, application secret and consumer key relative to your own application (OVH Europe).
